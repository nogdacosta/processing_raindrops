Raindrops - developed on Processing inspired by “The Matrix”
developed back in 2010 - getting ready to update and add some more stuff (just to get back to my routes)

Keys:
1 - 9 control the speed of the rain (2 - 4 are the best looking)

Possible to change the drops color.
this version is using the real color, later I’ll add the possibility to dynamically change to a “Matrix” look-a-like.
